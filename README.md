## 🚧 Current Roles

In my role as *Accessibility Specialist* (head of the product accessibility team) I participate in:
- creating guidelines with use cases, examples, best practices for all parts of the team (POs, designers, developers and testers) in order to meet the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.1/2.2 accessibility criteria.
- advice and participation in accessible and inclusive design tasks on Figma, with the aim of providing an accessible experience from the very beginning. Participation in the creation of a library of components that can then be reused by other team members to reduce delivery times and align UI elements.
- creation of code components and their corresponding documentation in repositories for easy reuse by other developers on the team. At this stage it is essential to emphasise ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) to improve support for assistive technologies such as screen readers or braille keyboards.
- automatic and manual testing guidelines and demos for developers (unit testing) and QAs/Testers.
- regular meetings with other Accessibility Specialists in the company and Design System designers to implement new standards and tools.

In my role as *Software Developer* I participate in:
- development of new requirements with Microsoft technologies (.NET, C#, SQL Server) in the backend and with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+) and React in the frontend.
- implementation of standards, best practices and generation of documentation for continuous improvements in UX and DX.
- maintenance of core services and libraries for compliance with security and deployment standards.
