## 🚧 Current Roles

In my role as Accessibility Specialist (head of the product accessibility team), I participate in:
- Creating guidelines with use cases, examples, and best practices for all parts of the team (POs, designers, developers, and testers) to meet the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.1/2.2 accessibility criteria.
- Providing advice and participating in accessible and inclusive design tasks on Figma, with the aim of delivering an accessible experience from the very beginning. This includes participating in the creation of a component library that can be reused by other team members to reduce delivery times and align UI elements.
- Creating code components and their corresponding documentation in repositories for easy reuse by other developers on the team. At this stage, it is essential to emphasize ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) to improve support for assistive technologies such as screen readers or braille keyboards.
- Developing automatic and manual testing guidelines and demos for developers (unit testing) and QAs/Testers.
- Attending regular meetings with other Accessibility Specialists in the company and Design System designers to implement new standards and tools.

In my role as Software Developer, I participate in:
- Developing new requirements with Microsoft technologies (.NET, C#, SQL Server) in the backend and with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), and React in the frontend.
- Implementing standards, best practices, and generating documentation for continuous improvements in UX and DX.
- Maintaining core services and libraries to ensure compliance with security and deployment standards.
